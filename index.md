This website is devoted to my PhD research project which I tentatively named **Citation Networks in Classics**. Although there is information about it scattered around the web (for example [here](http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Extracting_Information_from_Classics_Scholarly_Texts)), I felt the need to gather as much information as possible in a single and easy updatable place.

<h3 class="caps"> The project in a glance </h3>
The project investigates how [references to ancient texts](/project.html#canonical-citation) contained in modern publications can be exploited to improve the retrieval of information in Classics.

This website is devoted to my PhD research project which I tentatively named **Citation Networks in Classics**. Although there is information about it scattered around the web (for example [here](http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Extracting_Information_from_Classics_Scholarly_Texts)), I felt the need to gather as much information as possible in a single and easy updatable place.

<h3 class="caps"> The project in a glance </h3>
For my doctoral research project I'm supervised by [Prof Willard McCarty (DDH)](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/people/core/mccarty) and [Shalom Lappin (KCL, Dept. of Philosophy)](http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/lappin/) <del>[Jonathan Ginzburg]</del>. My research was supported by an [Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)](http://www.ahrc.ac.uk) scholarship for the period September 2009 - May 2011.

The project investigates how [references to ancient texts](/project.html#canonical-citation) contained in modern publications can be exploited to improve the retrieval of information in Classics. ([read more](project.html))

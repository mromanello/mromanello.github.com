I'm well aware of the fact that the code I'm writing for my research won't probably make it into my dissertation.
Nevertheless I believe that's an integral part of it and I want to make it freely available for others.

Gabriel Bodard ([KCL](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/people/core/bodard), [DCWiki](wiki.digitalclassicist.org/User:GabrielBodard)) has recently articulated this argument in a very effective way in one [message](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=digitalclassicist;a90e97f7.1202) to the [Digital Classicist discussion list](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/digitalclassicist):
> Just as I cannot publish an article that will be taken seriously by
> classicists without including clear citations to the ancient texts or
> artefacts I'm working on, references to and acknowlegement of previous
> bibliography on the subject, and the logical processes by which I
> reach my conclusions, I should not be taken seriously if I publish a

> Access and Open Source.

I have codebases on [github](https://github.com/mromanello), [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/56k) and [assembla](www.assembla.com/profile/mromanello).

The main pieces of code/software I'm developing for my research are:

*	[CRefEx](https://github.com/mromanello/CRefEx) a Canonical Reference Extractor. CRefEx is composed of

	*	[Canonical Citation Extractor](https://github.com/mromanello/CitationExtractor)
	*	[Canonical Citation Parser](https://github.com/mromanello/CitationParser)
*	[HuCit](https://bitbucket.org/56k/hucit) a Humanities Citation Ontology (in collaboration with [Dr Michele Pasin](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/people/core/pasin))
*	[jQuery OmniViewer](https://github.com/kcl-ddh/omniviewer) Slightly unrelated--but still interesting--image viewer jQuery plugin that I've developed for the [KCL DDH](https://github.com/kcl-ddh)

I'm [PhD student](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/people/students/romanello/) at the Department of Digital Humanities, King's College London.
I'm also research associate at the Deutsches Archeologisches Institut where I work on the [DARIAH-DE](http://de.dariah.eu/) project.

I do my very best to keep a [research blog](http://c4tc.wordpress.com/) where I post mainly about stuff related to my PhD.
In case you want to follow me on twitter [@mr56k](http://twitter.com/#!/mr56k).
I forgot to say... I'm a [Digital Classicist](http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/User:MatteoRomanello).

## Bio ##

Matteo Romanello is from Venice, Italy, where he received a BA in Classics and an MA in Digital Humanities from the Ca' Foscari University of Venice in 2005 and 2008 respectively. 
Between October 2008 and May 2009 he was visiting research scholar at the [Perseus Project (Tufts University, Medford, MA)](www.perseus.tufts.edu) where he worked under the supervision of Gregory Crane on 
digital editions of fragmentary texts. 

Since October 2009 Matteo is doing his PhD in Digital Humanities, at the Department of Digital Humanities, King's College London. 
His doctoral research, supervised by Willard McCarty (KCL, DDH) and Shalom Lappin (KCL, Department of Philosophy), investigates the use of citations to ancient texts contained in 
journal papers as a means of enhancing information retrieval in Classics.
In June 2011 Matteo joined the [Deutsches Archäologisches Institut (DAI)](http://www.dainst.org/en/) in Berlin to work on the EU-funded project 
[Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH-DE)](http://www.dariah.eu/). 
His main research interests include: interoperability, domain-specific information extraction and retrieval, applications of ontological modelling to the knowledge domain of Classics and citation network analysis.

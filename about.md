title: About me
---
I'm [PhD student](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/people/students/romanello/) at the Department of Digital Humanities, King's College London.
I'm also research associate at the Deutsches Archeologisches Institut where I work on the [DARIAH-DE](http://de.dariah.eu/) project.

I do my very best to keep a [research blog](http://c4tc.wordpress.com/) where I post mainly about stuff related to my PhD.
In case you want to follow me on twitter [@mr56k](http://twitter.com/#!/mr56k).
I forgot to say... I'm a [Digital Classicist](http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/User:MatteoRomanello).
